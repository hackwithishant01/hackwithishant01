## 🧠 About Me

I’m **Ishant**, an aspiring **penetration tester and ethical hacker** with a strong focus on **real-world cybersecurity practices**, not just tool usage.

I actively build hands-on experience through **legal labs, simulations, and controlled environments**, preparing myself for roles in both the **private cybersecurity industry** and, long-term, **government cyber & intelligence units** 🇮🇳.

My approach is to first gain **deep technical expertise and industry exposure in the private sector**, while steadily working toward contributing to **national cybersecurity and digital defense** initiatives.

### 🧭 What I Believe In

- 🔐 **Ethics before exploitation** — legality and responsibility come first  
- 🧠 **Understanding systems, not just tools**  
- 🧪 **Hands-on practice over theoretical learning**  
- 📜 **Documentation & clarity over shortcuts**  
- 📈 **Long-term growth through discipline and consistency**  
- 🤝 **Collaboration, knowledge sharing, and mentorship**

## 🛡️ Areas of Expertise
