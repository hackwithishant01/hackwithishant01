## 🧠 About Me

I’m **Ishant**, an aspiring **penetration tester and ethical hacker** with a strong focus on **real-world cybersecurity practices**, not just tool usage.

I actively build hands-on experience through **legal labs, simulations, and controlled environments**, preparing myself for roles in both the **private cybersecurity industry** and, long-term, **government cyber & intelligence units** 🇮🇳.

My approach is to first gain **deep technical expertise and industry exposure in the private sector**, while steadily working toward contributing to **national cybersecurity and digital defense** initiatives.

### 🧭 What I Believe In

- 🔐 **Ethics before exploitation** — legality and responsibility come first  
- 🧠 **Understanding systems, not just tools**  
- 🧪 **Hands-on practice over theoretical learning**  
- 📜 **Documentation & clarity over shortcuts**  
- 📈 **Long-term growth through discipline and consistency**  
- 🤝 **Collaboration, knowledge sharing, and mentorship**

## 🛡️ Areas of Expertise
### 🔐 Cybersecurity & Penetration Testing

- **Web Application Security**
  - OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities (SQLi, XSS, IDOR, Auth issues, etc.)
  - Manual testing methodology (recon → exploitation → validation)
  - Secure coding & mitigation understanding

- **Network Security & Traffic Analysis**
  - Network reconnaissance & enumeration
  - ARP-based attacks & MITM concepts (lab environments only)
  - Packet inspection, traffic flow analysis, and anomaly detection
  - Understanding switching, routing, and TCP/IP behavior

- **Offensive & Defensive Techniques**
  - Attack surface mapping
  - Privilege escalation concepts (Linux-focused)
  - Basic blue-team perspective (log analysis, detection basics)

- **Social Engineering Awareness**
  - Phishing simulation & analysis (GoPhish – educational use)
  - User awareness & defensive countermeasures

- **Linux Security**
  - Linux internals for security testing
  - Permission models, processes, services, and hardening basics
